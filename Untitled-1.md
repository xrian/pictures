Parallel Gateway



Lanes show responsibility in which type of BPMN object?

Pool



According to Camunda best practices, events should be described in active voice (i.e. "send message")

False


Complex gateways are supported in BPMN 2.0 and on the Camunda Platform?

False







Which object can directly follow an event-based gateway?

Timer event






You should name your XOR gateways in your process model usingâ€¦?

A question



Which statement about timer events is true?

Can be placed at the start of a process as a start event



The main purpose of the message event is to facilitate process-to-process communication?

True




Implicit modeling is generally more clear and the preferred method for process modeling?

False





Which statement about sub processes is true?

Camunda does not allow for collapsing subprocesses





What does the call activity object allow for?

Creating reusable processes



Timer events as boundary events must always be interrupting

False



Why do we use collapsed pools?

To represent another process that we're communicating with without needing to model it explicitly




What is the main difference between interrupting and non-interrupting boundary events?

Interrupting events actually cancel the task that they're attached to





What do we use annotations for?

Providing more information about one or more objects in a process model



Which statement about data objects is true?

The engine ignores the presence of these objects




Asynchronous communication involves real time communication where the process is blocked until a response is received?

False



A collaboration diagram describes how two or more processes interact with one another?

True




Business rule tasks should be used mainly when we are not using DMN for business rules?

False



Collapsed event subprocess are allowed both in Camunda and BPMN 2.0

False



Which statement best describes the difference between a message event and a signal event?

Message events have a 1-to-1 relationship, while signal events have a 1-to-many relationship




Event subprocesses can be placed inside embedded subprocesses?

True




Which is a valid scenario for using an event sub process?

We want a catching event that is triggerable throughout an entire process



Which of the following examples indicate indirect coupling?

Two processes reading from the same database




Which boundary events are valid for an embedded sub process?

All of the above


The compensation event allows for reverting tasks completed earlier in the model?

True


Which of these events is supported by Camunda and BPMN 2.0

Compensation event



Why do we use link events?

To reduce clutter in a model


Service tasks are similar to user tasks in that we're expecting an actual person to complete the task

False




Which statement about user tasks is false?

They allow the engine to automate human tasks in a way that actual human interaction is not needed



An interrupting event sub process will always eventually end the entire process if triggered

True




You can only have one event sub process per process model?

False

A call activity is an example of indirect coupling?

False




Which is NOT a requirement for modern BPM workflow engines?

Less focus on the developer




What is digitalization?

Transforming information from physical materials to a digital form




Which of these statements best describes an algorithm?

A methodical set of steps to solve a problem




What is an advantage of using Camunda over zero code BPM suites?

Flexibility, can cover a larger range of scenarios




Which component is NOT a part of the Camunda Platform?

Process Manager



A Process Engine is used for executing process models?

True






What does an interrupting boundary event do?

It allows for tasks to be cancelled based on an event













Which one of these is a valid gateway type in BPMN?

Parallel Gateway



BPMN can and should be used to explicitly model business rules?

False



The properties panel allows developers to add technical information to a model?

True




What is a DRD?

A model that allows you to define hierarchical decisions in DMN




What does DMN stand for?

Decision Model and Notation




What does the 'Unique' hit policy do?

Enforces that one and only one rule can match within a DMN table





What does a BPMN file actually contain?

XML markup for describing a process



Service Tasks are used to implement actions outside of the process engine, for example the invocation of a Web Service?

True


In an abstract sense, which two areas does process automation bring together?

System integration and human task management


Why do we use Cockpit?

It allows us to monitor our processes


What is the Tasklist used for?

Completing user tasks









What's the difference between a flow node and a process instance?

A flow node is an object in a process model while a process instance is a running form of that process model


Optimize allows us to create custom reports that describe the performance of our processes at scale?

True


Which is not an example of a KPI?

Object count in a process model
